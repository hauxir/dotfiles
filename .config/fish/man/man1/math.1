.SS "Synopsis"
\fCmath EXPRESSION\fP
.SS "Description"
\fCmath\fP is used to perform mathematical calculations\&. It is a very thin wrapper for the bc program, which makes it possible to specify an expression from the command line without using non-standard extensions or a pipeline\&.
.PP
For a description of the syntax supported by math, see the manual for the bc program\&. Keep in mind that parameter expansion takes place on any expressions before they are evaluated\&. This can be very useful in order to perform calculations involving environment variables or the output of command substitutions, but it also means that parenthesis have to be escaped\&.
.SS "Examples"
\fCmath 1+1\fP outputs 2\&.
.PP
\fCmath $status-128\fP outputs the numerical exit status of the last command minus 128\&.
