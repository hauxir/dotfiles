\fCfunction [OPTIONS] NAME; BODY; end \fP
.SS "Description"
\fCfunction\fP creates a new function \fCNAME\fP with the body \fCBODY\fP\&.
.PP
A function is a list of commands that will be executed when the name of the function is given as a command\&.
.PP
The following options are available:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-a NAMES\fP or \fC--argument-names NAMES\fP assigns the value of successive command-line arguments to the names given in NAMES\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-d DESCRIPTION\fP or \fC--description=DESCRIPTION\fP is a description of what the function does, suitable as a completion description\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-e\fP or \fC--on-event EVENT_NAME\fP tells fish to run this function when the specified named event is emitted\&. Fish internally generates named events e\&.g\&. when showing the prompt\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-j PID\fP or \fC --on-job-exit PID\fP tells fish to run this function when the job with group ID PID exits\&. Instead of PID, the string 'caller' can be specified\&. This is only legal when in a command substitution, and will result in the handler being triggered by the exit of the job which created this command substitution\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-p PID\fP or \fC --on-process-exit PID\fP tells fish to run this function when the fish child process with process ID PID exits\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-s\fP or \fC--on-signal SIGSPEC\fP tells fish to run this function when the signal SIGSPEC is delivered\&. SIGSPEC can be a signal number, or the signal name, such as SIGHUP (or just HUP)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-S\fP or \fC--no-scope-shadowing\fP allows the function to access the variables of calling functions\&. Normally, any variables inside the function that have the same name as variables from the calling function are 'shadowed', and their contents is independent of the calling function\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC-v\fP or \fC--on-variable VARIABLE_NAME\fP tells fish to run this function when the variable VARIABLE_NAME changes value\&.
.PP
.PP
If the user enters any additional arguments after the function, they are inserted into the environment \fCvariable array\fP \fC$argv\fP\&. If the \fC--argument-names\fP option is provided, the arguments are also assigned to names specified in that option\&.
.PP
By using one of the event handler switches, a function can be made to run automatically at specific events\&. The user may generate new events using the \fCemit\fP builtin\&. Fish generates the following named events:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCfish_prompt\fP, which is emitted whenever a new fish prompt is about to be displayed\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCfish_command_not_found\fP, which is emitted whenever a command lookup failed\&.
.PP
.SS "Example"
.PP
.nf

function ll
        ls -l $argv
end
.fi
.PP
.PP
will run the \fCls\fP command, using the \fC-l\fP option, while passing on any additional files and switches to \fCls\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf

function mkdir -d 'Create a directory and set CWD'
        command mkdir $argv
        if test $status = 0
                switch $argv[(count $argv)]
                        case '-*'

                                cd $argv[(count $argv)]
                                return
                end
        end
end
.fi
.PP
.PP
will run the mkdir command, and if it is successful, change the current working directory to the one just created\&.
