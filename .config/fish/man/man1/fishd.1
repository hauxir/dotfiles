\fCfishd [(-h|--help|-v|--version)]\fP
.SS "Description"
The \fCfishd\fP daemon is used to load, save and distribute universal variable information\&. \fCfish\fP automatically connects to \fCfishd\fP via a socket on startup\&.
.PP
\fCfishd\fP is started and stopped automatically\&.

The following options are available if starting \fCfishd\fP manually:

.SS "Files"
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fC~/\fP\&.config/fish/fishd\&.MACHINE_ID - permanent storage location for universal variable data\&. \fCMACHINE_ID\fP is generally based on the machine's MAC address\&.
.PP
The data is stored as a set of \fCset\fP and \fCset_export\fP commands such as would be parsed by fishd\&. The file must always be stored in YAML format\&. If an instance of fishd is running (which is generally the case), manual modifications to \fC~/\fP\&.fishd\&.MACHINE_ID will be lost\&. Do NOT edit this file manually!
